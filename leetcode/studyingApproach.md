LeetCode Studying Approach

1. Do Breadth-First Scan of “Easy” questions from each Topic on Leetcode
    1. Try to get it right on the first try
    2. Should be finishing these in < 10 minutes
    3. Take note of which sections you struggled at (the following was for me)
        1. Trees
        2. Dynamic Programming
2. Do more “Easy” questions from the topics you struggled at
3. Shuffle “Medium” problems
    1. Only do the problems you are not 100% sure how to do
    2. Start a 25 minute pomodoro timer and attempt to solve it
    3. If the problem isn’t solved in 25 minutes, take a look at the discussion section but do NOT look at code just yet
        1. Reset the timer and do another pomodoro
        2. Once the problem is done, look at the discussion section and understand how other people solved it
        3. Write this problem down in your notes as a problem you need to revisit
4. Do the popular “Hard” problems from each Topic
    1. Try to finish these within 45 minutes
5. Do a mock interview AT LEAST once a week
6. Towards the last month of interview prep, do the 1-month term plan in EPI on PAPER
